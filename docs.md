# 5-Day Flashloan Arbitrage Bot Development Plan

## Day 1: Project Setup & Smart Contract Basics

### 1.1: Project Setup  - DONE
**Tasks**:
- Set up **Node.js**, **Python**, **Hardhat**, and **Truffle**.
- Create the **project folder structure**.
- Initialize **Git repo** for version control.
- Install dependencies:
  - `npm install -g hardhat`
  - `pip install web3`
- Set up **Hardhat project**.
- Install **Subgraph dependencies** and set up **The Graph**.

### 1.2: Develop Flashloan Smart Contract - DONE
**Tasks**:
- Create a simple **Solidity contract** for flashloan borrowing.
- Implement functionality to borrow from **Aave** and swap using **Uniswap/SushiSwap**.
- Write the flashloan arbitrage contract: borrow funds, check for arbitrage, and execute the trade.

### 1.3: Deploy Smart Contract on Test Network  - NOW WE ARE WORKING ON TESTING IT 
**Tasks**:
- Deploy the **flashloan contract** on **Rinkeby** or **Polygon Mumbai**.
- Verify the contract on the testnet with **MetaMask**.
- Ensure contract interaction works using **Hardhat** and **Truffle**.

---

## Day 2: Developing the Arbitrage Bot

### 2.1: DEX Price Fetching and Arbitrage Calculation
**Tasks**:
- Write a **Python/Node.js script** to fetch real-time prices from **Uniswap**, **SushiSwap**, and **QuickSwap** via **Subgraph API** (GraphQL).
- Implement logic to identify **price discrepancies** and calculate potential profits (after considering fees and slippage).

### 2.2: Integrate Flashloan Contract with Bot
**Tasks**:
- Integrate the **flashloan contract** into the bot to borrow funds for arbitrage.
- Implement the logic to **swap the borrowed tokens** on DEXs (**Uniswap**, **SushiSwap**, etc.) if an arbitrage opportunity is detected.

---

## Day 3: Testing & Optimization

### 3.1: Test the Arbitrage Contract
**Tasks**:
- Test the **flashloan contract** thoroughly on the testnet: simulate profitable arbitrage scenarios.
- Perform a few test trades on **Polygon Mumbai** using the test **USDT**.

### 3.2: Optimize Gas Fees and Execution Logic
**Tasks**:
- Check **gas usage** and **optimize** the contract and bot for cheaper execution.
- Ensure that the bot calculates and accounts for **gas fees**, **slippage**, and potential profit before executing the trade.

### 3.3: Test Arbitrage Bot on Testnet
**Tasks**:
- Run the **arbitrage bot** in a controlled test environment to simulate real-world conditions.
- Test with low amounts to ensure everything works correctly and safely.

---

## Day 4: Deploying on Mainnet and Real-Time Testing

### 4.1: Deploy Flashloan Contract on Mainnet (Polygon)
**Tasks**:
- Deploy the **flashloan contract** to the **Polygon Mainnet** using **Hardhat**.
- Ensure your wallet is funded with enough **MATIC** to cover gas fees.
- Interact with the contract on the mainnet using **MetaMask**.

### 4.2: Deploy the Arbitrage Bot
**Tasks**:
- Deploy and configure the **arbitrage bot** to connect to the **mainnet (Polygon)**.
- Ensure the bot can correctly fetch data from DEXs (Uniswap, SushiSwap, etc.) on the mainnet and perform flashloan operations.
- Test for real-time price discrepancies and verify that the bot executes trades properly.

---

## Day 5: Security Review, Monitoring, and Final Testing

### 5.1: Security Review
**Tasks**:
- Perform a **security audit** on the contract for potential vulnerabilities (e.g., reentrancy, underflow/overflow, etc.).
- Check that **gas optimization** and **transaction security** are handled properly.

### 5.2: Monitor and Adjust Bot
**Tasks**:
- Set up **monitoring** for the bot (e.g., **Telegram alerts** or **email notifications**) to notify you of trades.
- Test live arbitrage on the **Polygon mainnet** with real amounts and check the botâ€™s behavior in real-time.

### 5.3: Final Review and Optimization
**Tasks**:
- Review the whole project and **optimize** where necessary (e.g., ensure that the bot runs smoothly with minimal downtime).
- Finalize the **documentation** for the project.
- Record or log any final results and performance metrics.

---

## Summary of Tasks by Day

### **Day 1**:
- Set up the project, install dependencies, create a simple **flashloan contract**.
- Deploy contract on **testnet** and interact with it.

### **Day 2**:
- Build the **arbitrage bot** that fetches **DEX prices**.
- Integrate **flashloan contract** for borrowing and swapping.

### **Day 3**:
- Test the **flashloan contract** and **optimize** it for gas.
- Run **arbitrage bot** on **testnet**.

### **Day 4**:
- Deploy **flashloan contract** on the **Polygon Mainnet**.
- Deploy and test the **arbitrage bot** on the mainnet with **live trades**.

### **Day 5**:
- Perform a **security review**, set up **monitoring** for the bot, and finalize any adjustments.
- Review the whole project, log results, and **optimize performance**.
